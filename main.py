# text code for welcome message in game https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52856030/how-to-fade-in-and-out-a-text-in-pygame

# GOALS
# Create another class with Player 2
# increase playing ground with game settings
# add code where when each player hits a mob, another one spawns
# add competition goal, first to hit #points wins
# add ID to player, "P1" and "P2" to respective player

# Final Project
# add a starting screen
# add a sounds for each player, so that you can differentiate who hits a mob
